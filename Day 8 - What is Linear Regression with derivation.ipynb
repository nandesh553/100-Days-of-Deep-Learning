    "## Simple Linear Regression / Univariate Linear Regression\n",
    "As the name suggests this algorithm is used for Regression problems and again from the name we can infer that Linear Regression is a Linear Model. This basically means that this algorithm establishes a linear relationship between the input variable(X) and the single output variable (Y).\n",
    "It is the simplest model in Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out this article on my blog [100 Days of Deep Learning](https://nandeshwar.in/100-days-of-deep-learning/what-is-linear-regression-with-derivation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are multiple input variables(X), it is called Multiple Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm we consider an input variable - X and one output variable - Y. We have to establish a linear relationship between them. The linear relationship can be defined as follows.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\beta_{1}$ is called scale factor or slope or coefficient\n",
    "* $\\beta_{0}$ is called intercept or bias coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is similar to the slope of a line ie $y = mx +b$ where $m = \\beta_{1}$ (Slope of the line) and $b = \\beta_{0}$ (Intercept). Hence we can state that in the Simple Linear Regression model we want to draw a line between X and Y which defines the relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions for Linear Regression\n",
    "1. A linear relationship between features and the target variable.\n",
    "2. **Additivity** means that the effect of changes in one of the features on the target variable does not depend on values of other features. For example, a model for predicting revenue of a company have one of the two features - the number of items \"a\" sold and the number of items \"b\" sold. When company sells more items \"a\" the revenue increases and this is independent of the number of items \"b\" sold. But, if customers who buy \"a\" stop buying \"b\", the additivity assumption is violated.\n",
    "3. No correlation between features (no collinearity). This affects the model severely.\n",
    "4. **[Homoscedasticity](https://www.statisticshowto.com/homoscedasticity/)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different types of Linear Regression\n",
    "1. **Univariate Linear Regression or Simple Linear Regression** - Single Variable Linear Regression is a technique used to model the relationship between a single input independent variable (feature variable) and an output dependent variable using a linear model i.e a line.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Linear Regression** - It is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a single dependent variable.\n",
    "3. **Ridge Regression** - Ridge Regression is a technique for analyzing multiple regression data that suffer from multicollinearity. When multicollinearity occurs, least squares estimates are unbiased, but their variances are large so they may be far from the true value. By adding a degree of bias to the regression estimates, ridge regression reduces the standard errors\n",
    "4. **Lasso Regression** - Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the *mean*. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). \n",
    "\n",
    "## How does Simple Linear Regression work?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main task of this algorithm is to find the best line which fits the given input data\n",
    "    \n",
    "The hypothesis is defined by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{\\theta}(x_{i}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y_{i}} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{i} \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h_{\\theta}(x_{i})$ represents the predictive response for $i_{th}$ observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordinary Least Square\n",
    "One of the most common and accurate methods is the Ordinary Least Square method.\n",
